check_graphite is a nagios module to query graphite

[![Build
Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/pyr/check-graphite.png)](http://travis-ci.org/pyr/check-graphite)


## Example

check_graphite -H 'http://my.graphite.host

check_graphite  -H "http://your.graphite.host/render" -M collectd.somebox.load.load.midterm  -w 1 -c 2 -N load
WARNING|load=1.4400000000000002;;;;

check_graphite accepts the following options:

* `-H` or `--endpoint`: the graphite HTTP endpoint which can be queried
* `-M` or `--metric`: the metric expression which will be queried, it can be an expression
* `-F` or `--from`: time frame for which to query metrics, defaults to "30seconds"
* `-N` or `--name`: name to give to the metric, defaults to "value"
* `-U` or `--username`: username used for basic authentication
* `-P` or `--password`: password used for basic authentication
* `-w`: warning threshold for the metric
* `-c`: critical threshold for the metric
* `-t`: timeout after which the metric should be considered unknown
* `--ignore-missing`: return `OK` when the metric doesn't exist yet e.g. errors have not occurred
* `--projection`: Warn on a value linearly extrapolated into the future, defaults to "2days"

## How it works

check_graphite, asks for a small window of metrics, and computes an average over the last valid
points collected, it then checks the value against supplied thresholds. Thresholds are expressed
in the format given in [The Nagios Developer Guidelines](http://nagiosplug.sourceforge.net/developer-guidelines.html#THRESHOLDFORMAT).

NaN values are not taken into account in the average

When running with --projection, note that you probably want to set a bigger --from window so you get a reasonable projection. Both --from and --projection accepts arguments in Graphite format.
